### What I learned

Learning how to work with a local `Json` file was some of my major learnings while working through this project. I also discover by working on this project thas using the `import` keyword alongside `assert` will not work with the `firefox` browser
```js
import datas from "./data.json" assert { type: "json" };
```

Intead i use the `fetch` API in order to be able to read and display data on every single browser 

### Useful resources

- [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-read-json-file-in-javascript/) - This helped me for reading data from `json` files
